# E-rated

## Background 

The E-rate Program provides federal funds (up to $3.9 billion a year) for discounts to assist eligible schools and libraries to obtain affordable internet access and telecommunications services. School eligibility is related to the number of students eligible for free and reduced lunch that they serve. Applying for these funds is generally outside the expertise of school systems so they hire consultants. Consultants typically work across state lines, however, given the lack of transparency and expertise in the e-rates market, it's challenging for school districts and libraries to know if the consultant provided them  the maximum possible discount. 

To understand the nuances of the E-rates market and how we could possible create a solution, we interviewed e-rate practitioners. Through this discussion we were able to better understand the underlying data and define our metric of success.

## Goal 

After understanding what the user is looking to purchase through the E-rates program, our tool aims to provide the user with the best consultant for their needs (“best” defined as firms with the lowest average gap between the amount of funds requested and the funding received for the given inputs).

## Functionality

Our tool enables users to gain insight into the top performing firms, access their contact information, leave reviews on prior experiences with consultants, and view other users' reviews.

## Data 

Our data came from the universal service administrative company’s [open data portal](https://opendata.usac.org/browse?category=E-rate&limitTo=datasets).
